# Raw data

Raw datasets are not included in this repository.

This project relies on replication data from previously published studies.
To reproduce the analysis, users must obtain the original datasets from the
replication packages associated with the following papers:

- **Fontana, N., Nannicini, T., and Tabellini, G. (2023)**  
  *Historical roots of political extremism: The effects of Nazi occupation of Italy*  
  Journal of Comparative Economics, 51(3), 723–743  
  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jce.2023.05.006

  Replication data obtained from the authors’ replication package, available
  as Supplementary Data to the published article.

- **Gagliarducci, S., Onorato, M. G., Sobbrio, F., and Tabellini, G. (2020)**  
  *War of the Waves: Radio and Resistance during World War II*

## Italian Institutional Referendum (1946)

Municipality-level results of the Italian institutional referendum held in 1946.
These data provide the main outcome variable used in the empirical analysis.

The original dataset is distributed as a plain text file (.txt) and is not
included in this repository.

Users interested in replication should obtain the dataset from the original
source and place the file in this directory using the filename expected by the
import script.
